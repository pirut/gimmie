# Millionaire Logic: Trust Me Bro

## What is this?

So, this is just a quick project I whipped up. My main goal was to get some real-world experience building something that folks can actually hop on and use.

## Why did I even make this?

This all started as a joke at work. My coworker and I were cracking up about someone who hit us up for cash with this gem: "Look dude, if everyone gave me a dollar and I gave everyone a dollar, we'd all be millionaires. Trust me bro."

It was such a stupid idea that I instantly thought, "Man, that would be a funny website!" So, I decided to make it just to see if I could pull it off.

## The repo name is spelled wrong...

I know
